# make_gems
Game: Make gemstones (loosely based on https://end3r.github.io/Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/demos/lesson16.html)

This is just an example program made with [FuncSug](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug) and [Phaser_ce](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce).

You can test it [here](https://cl4cnam.github.io/make_gems/makegemPhaserPy.html).
